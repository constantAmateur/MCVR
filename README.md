Implementation of [molecular cross validation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/786269v1) technique to determine ideal number of PCs for scRNA-seq in R.

The intent is for this to be used as part of a Seurat workflow to identify the ideal number of principal components to use in a rigorous way.  Refer to comments in the code for more detailed documentation.
